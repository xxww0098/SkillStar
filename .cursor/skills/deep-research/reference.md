## Query Decomposition Examples

### Comparison: "React vs Vue vs Svelte for enterprise dashboard"

```
Sub-queries:
  1. "React enterprise dashboard adoption performance 2026"
  2. "Vue.js enterprise dashboard large-scale production 2026"
  3. "Svelte enterprise dashboard production experience 2026"
  4. "frontend framework comparison criteria enterprise: bundle size, hiring, ecosystem, TypeScript"

Strategy: Parallel (all 4 are independent)
Tier: Standard (well-defined scope, 3 items to compare)
```

### Explanation: "How does Raft consensus algorithm handle leader election?"

```
Sub-queries:
  1. "Raft consensus algorithm overview leader election mechanism"
  2. "Raft leader election timeout split vote resolution"
  3. "Raft vs Paxos leader election differences"

Strategy: Sequential (start broad, then narrow based on what overview reveals)
Tier: Standard (technical depth needed, but focused topic)
```

### Investigation: "Why is our CI pipeline 3x slower since last month?"

```
Sub-queries (hypothesis-driven):
  Hypothesis A: Dependency changes increased install time
    -> use `Grep` for package or lockfile references in recent changes
  Hypothesis B: New test suite added significant runtime
    -> SemanticSearch for test configuration changes
  Hypothesis C: CI runner resource constraints changed
    -> read CI config files with `Read`, then search targeted symbols with `Grep`

Strategy: Parallel hypotheses, then sequential deep-dive on most likely
Tier: Standard (codebase-focused, bounded scope)
```

### Survey: "State of AI code generation tools in 2026"

```
Sub-queries:
  1. "AI code generation tools landscape 2026 overview"
  2. "GitHub Copilot vs Cursor vs Windsurf features comparison 2026"
  3. "open source AI coding assistants 2026"
  4. "AI code generation enterprise adoption challenges 2026"
  5. "AI code generation benchmarks accuracy 2026"
  6. "emerging AI coding tools startups 2026"

Strategy: Parallel (all independent), then sequential follow-ups on gaps
Tier: Exhaustive (broad landscape, many dimensions)
Task plan: launch 3 parallel `Task` investigations for queries 1-3, then 3 more for 4-6
```

### Fact-check: "Does HTTP/3 always outperform HTTP/2?"

```
Sub-queries:
  1. "HTTP/3 vs HTTP/2 performance benchmarks"
  2. "HTTP/3 disadvantages cases where HTTP/2 is faster"
  3. "HTTP/3 QUIC overhead high-latency networks"

Strategy: Sequential (need claim evidence first, then counter-evidence)
Tier: Quick (focused factual question)
```

## Research Type Decision Tree

When the research type is ambiguous, use this decision tree:

```
Does the user mention 2+ specific items to evaluate?
  YES -> Comparison
  NO  -> continue

Is the user asking "how" or "why" something works?
  YES -> Explanation
  NO  -> continue

Is there a specific problem, bug, or unexpected behavior?
  YES -> Investigation
  NO  -> continue

Is the user asking to verify a specific claim?
  YES -> Fact-check
  NO  -> continue

Is the scope broad (landscape, options, overview)?
  YES -> Survey
  NO  -> Default to Explanation
```

## Source Priority Matrix

| Research type | Primary source | Secondary source | Avoid |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Comparison** | Official docs, benchmarks | Community blog posts, HN/Reddit threads | Marketing pages |
| **Explanation** | Academic papers, official docs, RFCs | Tutorials, conference talks | Stack Overflow answers (often outdated) |
| **Investigation** | Codebase (`Grep`, `Read`, `SemanticSearch`) | Git history, CI logs | Generic web results |
| **Survey** | Industry reports, official announcements | Developer surveys, trend analyses | Individual opinion posts |
| **Fact-check** | Primary sources (papers, official docs) | Independent benchmarks | Social media, forums |

**When to use WebFetch after WebSearch:**
- The search snippet is promising but truncated
- You need specific numbers, code examples, or configuration details
- The source is a documentation page or technical blog with depth
- Do NOT WebFetch: social media, forums (search snippet is usually sufficient), or paywalled content

## Reflection Prompts (Detailed)

Use these at each reflection checkpoint. Pick the 2-3 most relevant for the current situation.

### Coverage assessment
- "Which of my original sub-queries can I now answer confidently?"
- "Are there dimensions I didn't anticipate that turned out to be important?"
- "Am I covering the topic breadth the user expects, or have I narrowed too early?"

### Confidence calibration
- "How many independent sources confirm my main findings?"
- "Are there any claims I'm treating as facts that come from a single informal source?"
- "Where do my sources disagree, and can I find a tiebreaker?"

### Diminishing returns check
- "Did my last 2 searches teach me anything I didn't already know?"
- "Am I searching for the same thing with different keywords?"
- "Would another search change my recommendation or conclusion?"

### Pivot detection
- "Has anything I found invalidated my original research plan?"
- "Is there a better framing of the question based on what I've learned?"
- "Should I split a sub-query that turned out to be more complex than expected?"

### Sufficiency test
- "If I had to write the report right now, what would be missing?"
- "Would a domain expert find obvious gaps in my coverage?"
- "Is the remaining uncertainty acceptable for the user's purpose?"

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Context Bloat

**Symptom**: Raw search results accumulate, pushing important earlier context out of the window.

**Prevention**: Compress every search result immediately. Never carry forward full page contents. Use the evolving summary pattern -- update it, don't append to it.

**Recovery**: If context is already bloated, write a fresh evolving summary from memory of key findings, discard everything else, and continue.

### 2. Tunnel Vision

**Symptom**: Deep-diving into one sub-query while neglecting others. Over-researching a tangent.

**Prevention**: The reflection checkpoint forces periodic assessment of ALL sub-queries, not just the current one. The TodoWrite tracker makes gaps visible.

**Recovery**: Stop the current sub-query even if incomplete. Assess all sub-queries. Redistribute remaining search budget to the most important gaps.

### 3. Search Repetition

**Symptom**: Same information coming back from multiple searches with slightly different keywords.

**Prevention**: After 2 searches returning similar results, that sub-query is answered. Move on.

**Recovery**: Explicitly note "this sub-query is saturated" and redirect searches to unanswered questions.

### 4. Authority Confusion

**Symptom**: Treating all sources as equally reliable. Blog posts weighted the same as official docs.

**Prevention**: The compression template includes a confidence field. Always note whether a source is official documentation, peer-reviewed research, community content, or informal discussion.

**Recovery**: For any finding marked "uncertain", search specifically for an authoritative source to confirm or deny.

### 5. Scope Creep

**Symptom**: Research keeps expanding as new interesting tangents emerge. Never reaches synthesis.

**Prevention**: The research brief defines "out of scope" explicitly. The tier sets a search budget. Exhaustive tier has a hard cap of ~15 searches before mandatory synthesis.

**Recovery**: Return to the research brief. Ask: "Does this new tangent serve the original question?" If not, mention it as a "further reading" suggestion but don't research it.

### 6. Premature Synthesis

**Symptom**: Jumping to conclusions after 1-2 searches without checking alternative viewpoints.

**Prevention**: The reflection checkpoint requires checking for contradictions and alternative perspectives before declaring sufficiency. Minimum of 2 independent sources for any high-confidence claim.

**Recovery**: Before synthesizing, explicitly search for counter-evidence: "[main finding] criticism", "[main finding] limitations", "[main finding] alternatives".
