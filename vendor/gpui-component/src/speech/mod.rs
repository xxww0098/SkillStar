//! Speech input: capture audio, recognize it and hand the text to the caller.
//!
//! [`SpeechState`] owns a session and [`SpeechButton`] and [`SpeechWaveform`]
//! render it. Recognition and audio capture are both replaceable:
//! implement [`SpeechRecognizer`] to use any speech service and [`AudioInput`]
//! to feed audio from anywhere.
//!
//! With the `speech` feature, a state without its own recognizer falls back to
//! the `SystemRecognizer` of macOS or Windows, and captures from the
//! `Microphone`. Linux has no system recognizer, so speech input works there
//! only with an application recognizer.
